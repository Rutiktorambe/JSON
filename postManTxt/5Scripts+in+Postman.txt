Scripts in Postman
=================
Variables in Postman  --> Pre-request script Tab

postman scripts
-------------------
different stages

pre-request script
	Runs before request is sent
	create variables before sending a request



post-response script
	script that runs after recieveing the response
	create response validations after recieving the response
	Delete variables after recieveing responses

Workflow of scripts
-------------------
Pre-request script --> Request --> API --> Resposne --> Post response script

Levels of script
----------------

workspace
	collection
		folder
		    Requests
collection
	folder
	     Requests

collection --> group of requests
folder --> subgroups in a collection
Request --> individual HTTP Request

python --> print() --> displays information in console
Javascript --> console.log() --> displays information in console


A pre-request script associated with a collection will run prior to every request in the collection.
A pre-request script associated with a folder will run prior to every direct child request in the folder.

A post-response script associated with a collection will run after every request in the collection.
A post-response script associated with a folder will run after every direct child request in the folder.


To create variables instead of postman UI we will use JAVASCRIPT STATEMENTS

Global Variable  → pm.globals.set("userid_global", "2");
Environment Variable  → pm.environment.set("userid_qa_env", "2");
Collection Variable  →  pm.collectionVariables.set("userid_collect", "2");
Local Variable  →  pm.variables.set("userid_local", "2");


Using Variables in Request Body
--------------------------------
POST --> Create a user
