Data Driven Testing using CSV or JSON file


When we upload a file (single or multiple) through a web UI, an API is triggered in the background.

This API receives the file from the client and sends the request to the server. Then, the uploaded files are stored on the server or in the database.

Every file type has a specific MIME type. MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) tells the browser or server what kind of file is being sent.







201 Created means the server created a new resource (like a new file or record) as a result of your POST request.

200 OK means the request was successful, but the server might not have created anything new — maybe it just accepted or processed your data.

In file uploads, some servers respond with 200 if they just received and processed the file without creating a new resource with a unique URL. Others use 201 if they treat the upload as creating a new resource you can access later.

So both can be correct — it depends on how the server handles the upload!
