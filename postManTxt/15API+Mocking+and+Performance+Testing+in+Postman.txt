Mock Server in Postman

Existing collection
New collection

Postman generates Base URL when we create a mock server.

Mock server is only for Temporary purpose.Actual data-level validations should be performed on real data from the actual database server, not on mock server data.

So, give less importance to validations done on mock server data, as it is only simulated and may not reflect real-time scenarios.


Postman is not a full-fledged performance testing tool like JMeter or Gatling or Load Runner or k6 or Locust.
But it can simulate basic performance testing scenarios using Postman Runner or scripts with iterations, and integrate with Newman + CLI + external tools.

Imagine 100 people ordering pizza

	90 people got their pizza in less than 51 ms (super fast!).
	95 people got it in less than 56 ms (still pretty fast).
	99 people got it in less than 269 ms. Only 1 person waited longer than 2,110 ms.

90th/95th/99th percentile?
---------------------------
These are performance metrics that show how fast most requests were.
It tells: "X% of requests were completed in this much time or less."
