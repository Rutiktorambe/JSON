Postman KickStart
------------------
Introduction to Postman
-----------------------
API Testing Tool
Manual Testing of API's
Javascript basics is required
Developers uses postman to create API Documentation
Rest API and SOAP API's
web + Desktop versions


Workspace
---------
Collaborative environment --> organize and manage api's
Create, rename, delete


Collection
-----------
group of related API request togethor
Create, rename, delete and run collection
Multiple collections can be created under one single workspace
Once we create a collection we can create a request.



Request
-------
API Call --> method+endpoint+headers+body
Request --> API --> Resposne

Get   →  retrieve the resource from database
Post  →  create resource on database
Put  →  update existing resource on database
Patch  → update partial details of resource
Delete  →  delete existing resource from database


status code, time, size data, response body (json/xml), cookies, headers.

status code --> we can say a request is successfull or not


Workspace --> collection --> API Request


HTTP/HTTPS --> Schema+Hostname+Post+path+Query String or Parameters+Fragment



Scheme: Specifies the protocol (e.g., https or http).
Hostname: Identifies the server (e.g., www.example.com).
Port: Optional; follows the hostname with a colon (e.g., :80).
Path: Points to the specific resource (e.g., /software/index.html).
Query String or Query Params: Optional; starts with ? and contains parameters (e.g., term=bluebird).

A fragment identifier which is optional, added after `#` in a URL, points to a specific section or function within the retrieved resource, like a subsection in an HTML page, and its behavior depends on the media type.

Schema and Hostname --> Case Insenitive

Path + Query strings --> Case - sensitive


Swagger Documentation  --> Birth Certicate



https://reqres.in/   +   /api/users?page=2


https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2


Changes in Postman by default are unsaved.. we need to save every time

Autosave
--------
settings --> General section --> enable AutoSave







Creation of  Dummy APIs, JSON & JSONPath
-----------------------------------------
Dummy APIs --> our own API's

NodeJs
npm
json-server


C:\Program Files\nodejs\

{
    "name": "Scott",
    "location": "France",
    "phone": "123456",
    "courses": [
        "C",
        "C++"
    ]
}





{
    "name": "Scott",
    "location": "Germany",
    "phone": "654321",
    "courses": [
        "C#",
        "C++"
    ]

}


JSON --> Javascript object Notation


None --> null


Python --> List --> Array --> JSON

[1,2,3,4]

JSON --> JSON PATH


XML --> XPATH


Validations
-------------

Actual data == Expected data   --> TC passes




Xpath --> /   --> . --> JSONPATH

Response Validations(Assertions)
--------------------------------
Create Dummy API's
JSON
JSON Path
	dot notation
	brackets

Assertions --> Validation Points

Request --> API --> Response

Java --> TestNg --> TestNG Assertions
Python --> PyTest --> Assesrtions

Postman --> Chailibrary  --> JS/TS

Response information
----------------------
status code
	Indicates the result of the API request. It helps identify the outcome of the request.

Headers
	Provide additional metadata in the form key-value pairs about the response, such as the type of data 	returned (e.g., JSON), server details, caching rules, or security policies.


Cookies
	Small pieces of data sent by the server to the client, often used to maintain sessions, track user 	activity, or store user preferences. Cookies are not found when running the API locally; they are only 	visible when accessed through the internet.

Response Time
Response body
JSON Schema --> data about data --> metadata

Get   -> details
Post
Put
Patch
Delete


Postman --> validations --> scripts tab --> Post Response

Status of validations --> Test Results







Variables in Postman
--------------------
Variable
--------
container or placeholder to store some data  --> urls, requests, scripts, collecftions

avoid hard coding of values
to make reusable scripts
to manage configurations --> QA, UAT, Prod

Types and Scope of Variables
----------------------------
Environments --> (workspace --> group of collections --> group of requests)

Global variable  --> varibale created at workspace level --> accessible in workspace
Environmental variable  --> specific to environment
Collection Variable --> specific to collection of requests
Local Variable  --> specific to request


Data Variable or External Variable  --> Data Driven Testing


varaiable with same --> local variable , Global varaible


If a variable with the same name is declared in two different scopes, the value stored in the variable with narrowest scope will be used.
 For example, if there is a global variable named username and a local variable named username, the local value will be used when the request runs.


Access Variables
---------------
Any variable --> {{variable_name}}

https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2

Base_Url  = https://reqres.in
path = /api/users
Query = page=2 

Global Variable
--------------
workspace level

Python --> default arguments

Environmental variable
---------------------
create any env variable --> first we need to create environment

Collection variable
--------------------
collection level


Local Variable
-------------
we cannot create through UI
Request Level
Pre-Request Script  --> Javascript statement



In Real time we will create any type of variable using JavaScript Statements using snippets instead of using UI options.














Scripts in Postman
=================
Variables in Postman  --> Pre-request script Tab

postman scripts
-------------------
different stages

pre-request script
	Runs before request is sent
	create variables before sending a request



post-response script
	script that runs after recieveing the response
	create response validations after recieving the response
	Delete variables after recieveing responses

Workflow of scripts
-------------------
Pre-request script --> Request --> API --> Resposne --> Post response script

Levels of script
----------------

workspace
	collection
		folder
		    Requests
collection
	folder
	     Requests

collection --> group of requests
folder --> subgroups in a collection
Request --> individual HTTP Request

python --> print() --> displays information in console
Javascript --> console.log() --> displays information in console


A pre-request script associated with a collection will run prior to every request in the collection.
A pre-request script associated with a folder will run prior to every direct child request in the folder.

A post-response script associated with a collection will run after every request in the collection.
A post-response script associated with a folder will run after every direct child request in the folder.


To create variables instead of postman UI we will use JAVASCRIPT STATEMENTS

Global Variable  → pm.globals.set("userid_global", "2");
Environment Variable  → pm.environment.set("userid_qa_env", "2");
Collection Variable  →  pm.collectionVariables.set("userid_collect", "2");
Local Variable  →  pm.variables.set("userid_local", "2");


Using Variables in Request Body
--------------------------------
POST --> Create a user













API Chaining
-------------
Prerequest script --> request --> response --> PostResposne Script

API Chaining --> executing multiple requests in order where response or part of response of one request is used as an input to another requests

Dependency between requests

we will store response or part of response in a variable


https://gorest.co.in/ --> Demonstration of API Chaining  --> Rest API + GraphQL  --> Bearer Token Authentication


b1602b1675864f0184bf8d5f875ddd5821ae338eb11f7f155033bf9aa029159f

d313b254812a63c491e54e8264200731ef2df8943bd9a5f90318b983cb50f2d1


Request UL --> Base URL + endpoint + Query Parameters

Base URL is common across all requests   --> https://gorest.co.in/

Collection --> multiple requests


{
    "name": "Mohan",
    "gender": "male",
    "email": "mohan@gmail.com",
    "status": "inactive"

}



[
    {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "has already been taken"
    }
]


In Request(s) we should not hard code any data


{
    "name": {{"username"}},
    "gender": "male",
    "email": {{"useremail"}},
    "status": "inactive"

}


{
    "id": 7886989,
    "name": "Deepa",
    "email": "Deepa@gmail.com",
    "gender": "male",
    "status": "inactive"
}















Customize Collection Run Order and Data Driven Testing
-------------------------------------------------------
API Chaining

Postman executes requests in order
In older versions of Postman --> Alphbetical Order

API Collection --> Simple-Books-API

pm.execution.setNextRequest()  --> Post Response Script Tab


Data Driven Testing
-------------------
Data-driven testing in Postman runs requests multiple times with different data from a CSV or JSON file to test various scenarios. Data-driven testing is done by using Data variables.


Local
Environmental
Global
Collection

Data Variables  --> Data Driven Testing
Data Variables names must match with names of columns in Test Data file


File Upload and Download in Postman
-----------------------------------

Customize collection run Order
Data Driven Testing using CSV or JSON file


When we upload a file (single or multiple) through a web UI, an API is triggered in the background.

This API receives the file from the client and sends the request to the server. Then, the uploaded files are stored on the server or in the database.


https://github.com/Madhan-091296/spring-boot-file-upload-download-rest-api-master


To run java archive we need java

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk24-mac

Check java --> Java -version

Open the commnd prompt where the file present and execute below command
	java -jar file-upload-RestAPI.jar

http://localhost:8080/




Every file type has a specific MIME type. MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) tells the browser or server what kind of file is being sent.







201 Created means the server created a new resource (like a new file or record) as a result of your POST request.

200 OK means the request was successful, but the server might not have created anything new — maybe it just accepted or processed your data.

In file uploads, some servers respond with 200 if they just received and processed the file without creating a new resource with a unique URL. Others use 201 if they treat the upload as creating a new resource you can access later.

So both can be correct — it depends on how the server handles the upload!









Authentication and Authorization Types in Postman - 1
-----------------------------------------------------
File Upload and File Download

Authentication --> verify identify of user
Authorization  --> Determine what actions or data can perform by user once he is authnticated

Authentications in Postman
--------------------------
Request --> Authorization Tab --> Auth Type --> List of Authorizations

Authentication and Authorization Types in Postman - 2
-----------------------------------------------------
No Auth
Basic Auth
Digest Auth
Bearer Token
JWT Token
API Key


OAuth --> Open Authorization

Rapido(client)   --> Google Map (Service Provider)

OAuth (Open Authorization) is a secure way to allow one app to access specific information from another app without sharing your credentials — giving limited, controlled access to only what you approve.


OAuth 1.0

	Temporary Request Token
	Approved Request Token
	Access Token




OAuth 2.0

OnlineStoreAPI - Project
-------------------------


workspace --> Collection --> group of requests belongs to specific module

An endpoint (or resource path) is a specific URL that represents a resource on the server. It defines the address where a client can access or manipulate data using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

A Data Model in API Testing defines the structure, relationships, and format of the data that the API accepts and returns. Purpose of Data Model is Ensures data consistency, Simplifies data validation, Helps define API request and response formats.


We create test cases based on the high-level technical document, but it doesn’t provide all the details. During test case writing, we have meetings with developers and product managers to clarify questions and add more information to the test cases as part of the process.

Test Cases --> TCM Tools

TestRail
JIRA (with Zephyr plugin)
Quality Center (ALM)
Xray (for JIRA)
qTest
TestLink
Azure DevOps (with Test Plans)


We should not hardcode any data in the request. we always take the data from the variables. Most of the times variable values are taken from external files.

every Module --> Collection  --> variable


Ground Work


JSON File  --> One round of Testing
CSV File  -->  Data Driven Testing


At the end of the day we will execute collection in remote agent machine(cloud/on-premise server)


Local machine(Outside of postman) --> make sure --> agent machine

When we run a collection inside Postman, global variables are used automatically.

But when we export the collection to run outside Postman like in Command Prompt, Jenkins, or GitHub, only the collection along with collection variables is exported not the global variables.

So, if our collection depends on global variables we must also export the global variables separately as an environment or global variable JSON file.


Postman does not provide a built-in detailed report.To generate a proper report automatically, you need to run the collection using Newman (Postman’s command-line tool).






Newman CLI,  Git and Jenkins
----------------------------
Run a collection --> project --> Collection Runner --> No reporting supporting is avaliable in postman

Newman CLI

Newman allows us to run Postman collections from the command line and generate different types of test reports, such as CLI, JSON, HTML, or JUnit.

It also enables seamless integration of Postman API tests into CI/CD pipelines like Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, etc., making it suitable for automated testing workflows.
