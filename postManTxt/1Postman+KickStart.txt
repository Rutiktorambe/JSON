Postman KickStart
------------------
Introduction to Postman
-----------------------
API Testing Tool
Manual Testing of API's
Javascript basics is required
Developers uses postman to create API Documentation
Rest API and SOAP API's
web + Desktop versions


Workspace
---------
Collaborative environment --> organize and manage api's
Create, rename, delete


Collection
-----------
group of related API request togethor
Create, rename, delete and run collection
Multiple collections can be created under one single workspace
Once we create a collection we can create a request.



Request
-------
API Call --> method+endpoint+headers+body
Request --> API --> Resposne

Get   →  retrieve the resource from database
Post  →  create resource on database
Put  →  update existing resource on database
Patch  → update partial details of resource
Delete  →  delete existing resource from database


status code, time, size data, response body (json/xml), cookies, headers.

status code --> we can say a request is successfull or not


Workspace --> collection --> API Request


HTTP/HTTPS --> Schema+Hostname+Post+path+Query String or Parameters+Fragment



Scheme: Specifies the protocol (e.g., https or http).
Hostname: Identifies the server (e.g., www.example.com).
Port: Optional; follows the hostname with a colon (e.g., :80).
Path: Points to the specific resource (e.g., /software/index.html).
Query String or Query Params: Optional; starts with ? and contains parameters (e.g., term=bluebird).

A fragment identifier which is optional, added after `#` in a URL, points to a specific section or function within the retrieved resource, like a subsection in an HTML page, and its behavior depends on the media type.

Schema and Hostname --> Case Insenitive

Path + Query strings --> Case - sensitive


Swagger Documentation  --> Birth Certicate
