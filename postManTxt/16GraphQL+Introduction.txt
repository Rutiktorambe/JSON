GraphQL Introduction
--------------------
Mocking
Performance Testing

Rest API Testing --> Get, Post, PUT, PATCH, Delete --> HTTPS protocol

Apart from Rest API we have other Architectures

GraphQL --> Graph Query Langugae

In RestAPI --> Different end points

Unlike REST APIs that use multiple endpoints for different operations, GraphQL uses a single endpoint (graphql). All operations like queries, mutations, and even subscriptions are sent via POST requests with the operation and data defined in the request body.

GraphQL is designed for developers of web/mobile apps (HTTP clients) to be able to make API calls to fetch exactly the data they need from their backend APIs.

Rest API --> Multiple end poinst + multiple http request methods

GraphQL --> Single endpoint(Graphql) + Post

GraphQL is a way to ask for data from a server, like saying
	"Hey server, give me this specific information only — nothing more, nothing less!"

GraphQL(Graph Query Language) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It is another alternative to RestAPI.

GraphQL -Client Server flow


GraphQL query is not really JSON; it looks like the shape of the JSON you want. So when we make a 'POST' request to send our GraphQL query to the server, it is sent as a "string" by the client.


GraphQL vs Rest
---------------
No extra Data
Fewer API Calls
No waiting for Backend team
Self Documnetation
	Every GraphQL API conforms to a "schema" which is the graph data model and what kinds of queries a 	client can make. This allows the community to build lots of cool tools to explore & visualise your API 	or create IDE plugins that autocomplete your GraphQL queries and even do "codegen". We'll understand 	this in more detail later!
